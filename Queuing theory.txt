Waiting is waste of time 
Reducing this helps reduce cost improve performance



Queuing theory focuses on how waiting lines behave.
Queuing theory is based on probability
Queuing theory views every system as interconnected set of servers and queues through which the customer flows. Once you are aware of queuing framework you 
Can decompose any sytem into network of servers and queues and analyze them individually or seperately

Queuing systems are denoted by Kendall's diagram that have 3 symbols 
- how arrival rates behave 
- how service times behave 
- how many servers ?
- Special parameters
they relate to whether
 the system has ?nite capacity and might reject arrivals
,how big the population of customers is
,and whether the queue does anything special to select which customer gets service next.

system description
M/M/1 - Markovian arrival , markovian service times , 1 server
M/M/m - Markovian arrival , markovian service times , m servers
M/G/1 - Markovian arrival , normal service times , 1 server
M/G/m - Markovian arrival , normal service times , 1 server


Mostly real life situations result in independent and randomly spaced arrivals.
Real life service times are exponentially distributed with most jobs completing pretty quickly,occassional outliers
taking longer.

The M/M/m and exponential distribution is equivalent to Normal distrbution in statistics(shows up everywhere and analysis is easy).
